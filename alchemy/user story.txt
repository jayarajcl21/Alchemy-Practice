it is the perspective of the end user 
User stories are part of an agile approach that helps shift the focus from writing about requirements to talking about them
Agile methodology is an flexible approach to software development that prioritizes collaboration, adaptability, and customer satisfaction
These stories use to provide context for the development team and their efforts. After reading a user story, the team knows why they are building, what they're building, and what value it creates.

ex: an hr application used to submit the claims of the employees 
1st user -employe who needs an interface to claim  .                   
2nd user - approver who needs an interface to approve.
3rd user - financiar who needs to monetize the claim

user story consits of the building blocks of agile 
1. epics - many number of user stories forms epic.
2. initiatives- combination of epics form initiatives

these helps us to know the perspective of different users 
advantages of user stories -
1.it delivers high quality content(bcoz wt to be accomplished at the user perspective would be clear).
2.it eases collabaration with team members (each member in a team has different view point on the user story).
3. improves transparency (as disscussions happens and user story wouldn't be picked like that collabaration helps in tramsparancy).

INVESTING IN USER STORY
1.the story shoul be valuable                        2.it should be estimable
